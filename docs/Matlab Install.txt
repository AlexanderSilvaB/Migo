In order to use Robot One in Matlab it is needed to add the R-One library to the Matlab path.
Currently only Matlab 64 bits is supported.

Adding the Robot One library
------------------------------------
Open Matlab and type in its console:
addpath('C:\robot-one\lib\matlab')


Save the path
------------------------------------
If it is desired that Matlab remember the library path, also type in the Matlab console:
savepath
